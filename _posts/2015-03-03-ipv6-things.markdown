# Comparison

|                   | IPv4                      | IPv6                   |
| :-------------    | :-------------:           | :-----:                |
| address size      | 32 bits                   | 128 bits               |
| address format    | (dotted decimal notation) | (hexadecimal notation) |
| prefix notation   | 192.168.1.1/24            | 2001:0DB8:0234::/48    |
| number of address | 2^32                      | 2^128                  |

to simplify IPv6 notation, 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334 ==> 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334


# [Turn IPv6 on and off in Mac OS X](http://osxdaily.com/2014/04/18/disable-ipv6-mac-os-x/)

```sh
# turn off
networksetup -setv6off Ethernet
# turn on
networksetup -setv6automatic Ethernet
```


# Visit IPv6 address using Chrome Address Bar

Just surround your IPv6 literals with brackets. e.g. Enter `[2607:f8b0:4007:808::2004]` or `https://[2607:f8b0:4007:808::2004]` in Chrome address bar

> `2607:f8b0:4007:808::2004` is one of IPv6 addresses of `google.com`


# PING over IPv6

```sh
ping6 google.com
```


# DNS Lookup

* `AAAA`: IPv6 DNS Record
* `A`: IPv4 DNS Record

```sh
nslookup -type=AAAA google.com
# or
dig -t AAAA google.com
# or
host -t AAAA google.com
```

> * For OS X Yosemite, there are MDNS (Multicast DNS) and UDNS (Unicast DNS) caches in OS X Yosemite, use `sudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache` and `sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches`
> * For OS X Mavericks, use `dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
> * visit [here](http://osxdaily.com/2008/03/21/how-to-flush-your-dns-cache-in-mac-os-x/) for more info
> 
> For Chrome browser caches, go to `chrome://net-internals/#dns` and clear host cache


# Getting IPv6 connectivity to the Internet

* your ISP provide you with IPv6-enabled internet connection in which case your ISP must be whitelisted by Google to receive `AAAA` records
* you can use tunnel broker such as `Hurricane Electric` or `SixXS` in which you can use their DNS caches

> I setup `Hurricane Electric` and I got this error -- `IP is not ICMP pingable. Please make sure ICMP is not blocked. If you are blocking ICMP, please allow 66.220.2.74 through your firewall.`.

# NOTICE: use one IPv6 DNS server as only DNS server may cause internet problem
